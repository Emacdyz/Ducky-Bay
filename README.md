## Client

It's build using `create-react-app`. You first need to `yarn` in order to get all the dependencies locally. To start the app `yarn start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly.

## Server

The server side is composed by a product table:

* `GET /products/:id`: select product by id
* `GET /products`: list all products
* `POST /products`: create new product
* `PUT /products/:id'`: update an existing product

### Running

You need a working Postgres database that is preferrably empty (drop all the tables) and running
Install the dependencies using `yarn` in your terminal.

Compile the app (Typescript > Javascript) using `yarn compile` or `tsc -w` on a seperate terminal window. To create the table on your database, you will need to type `node .` or `nodemon`, in a seperate window, while the other one is still running.
